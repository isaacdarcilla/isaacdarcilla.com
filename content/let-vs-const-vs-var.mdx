summary: 'Whatâ€™s the difference between using let, const, and var in JavaScript?'
---

The keywords `let` and `var` serve as variable declarations in JavaScript. The distinction between them lies in the scope of the variables they introduce.

## Let

Variables declared with `let` are confined to the block in which they are defined, ensuring a limited scope for their accessibility.

```js
function exampleLetScope() {
    if (true) {
        let x = 10;
        console.log(x); // Output: 10
    }

    // The following line would result in an error because 'x' is not defined here.
    console.log(x); // Error: x is not defined
}

exampleLetScope();
```

In this example, the variable `x` is declared using let within the if block, and it is only accessible within that block.

## Const

The `const` keyword in JavaScript is used to declare constants, which are variables that cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment.

```js
function exampleConst() {
    const PI = 3.14159;
    console.log(PI); // Output: 3.14159

    // The following line would result in an error because you cannot reassign a constant.
    PI = 4; // Error: Assignment to constant variable
}

exampleConst();
```

It's important to note that while the value of a variable declared with `const` cannot be changed, but the properties of objects and arrays declared with `const` can be modified.
The immutability applies to the variable reference, not the values it points to.

```js
function exampleConstArray() {
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
    console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3]

    // Modifying the array is allowed, as it's the array reference that is constant, not the values.
    numbers.push(4);
    console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

    // The following line would result in an error because you cannot reassign 'numbers'.
    numbers = [5, 6, 7]; // Error: Assignment to constant variable
}

exampleConstArray();
```

In this case, you can modify the content of the array (add elements), but you cannot assign a new array to the numbers variable.

## Var

Variables declared with `var` exhibit a broader scope, making them accessible throughout the entire function in which they are declared.

```js
function exampleVarScope() {
    if (true) {
        var y = 20;
        console.log(y); // Output: 20
    }

    // 'y' is accessible outside the block, even though it was declared inside the 'if' block.
    console.log(y); // Output: 20
}

exampleVarScope();
```

With `var`, the variable `y` is accessible both inside and outside the if block because `var` has a function-level scope, and the entire function is the scope in this case.

In modern JavaScript, it's generally recommended to use `let` and `const` over `var` due to the more predictable block-level scope behavior they provide.
