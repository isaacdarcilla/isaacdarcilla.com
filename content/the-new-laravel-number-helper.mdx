### Introduction: Laravel Number Class

In the realm of application development, the demand often arises for the nuanced formatting of numbers
to meet diverse criteria, be it for displaying them as currency, percentages, or human-readable file sizes.
Noticing a gap in Laravel's offerings for a specialized utility in this domain. This utility class, a culmination
of dedicated work over a span of time, has now found its place within the framework, marking an
exciting milestone. Let's explore the distinctive features it introduces.

### The Laravel Number Class

All methods are part of the class below:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Number;
```

Harness the format method to seamlessly format numbers based on the current locale:

```php
Number::format(25)        // 25
Number::format(100000)    // 100,000
Number::format(123456789) // 123,456,789
```

Customize locale settings for precise formatting:

```php
Number::format(123456789, locale: 'en') // 123,456,789
Number::format(123456789, locale: 'de') // 123.456.789
Number::format(123456789, locale: 'sv') // 123 456 789
```

Utilize the `formatPercentage` method for easy percentage representation:

```php
Number::percentage(25)                         // 25%
Number::percentage((1/3) * 100, precision: 2)  // 33.33%
```

Ideal for e-commerce applications, the `toCurrency` method provides seamless currency formatting with locale support:

```php
Number::toCurrency(10)                                   // $10.00
Number::toCurrency(25, currency: 'EUR')                  // €25.00
Number::toCurrency(5.49, currency: 'EUR', locale: 'de')  // 5.49 €
```

The `toFileSize` method, a pivotal feature, enables effortless conversion of file sizes:

```php
Number::toFileSize(1024)                    // 1 KB
Number::toFileSize(1600, precision: 2)      // 1.56 KB
Number::toFileSize(1024 * 1024 * 1024 * 5)  // 5 GB
```

For a more human-friendly representation, employ the `forHumans` method:

```php
Number::forHumans(1000)                 // 1 thousand
Number::forHumans(12345)                // 12 thousand
Number::forHumans(12345, precision: 3)  // 12.345 thousand
```
