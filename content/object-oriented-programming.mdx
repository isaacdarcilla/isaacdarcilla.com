### TL;DR

**Object-Oriented Programming** is a programming paradigm that uses the concept of "objects,"
which can encapsulate data and behavior. In OOP, there are several key terms and concepts.

Here are some of the fundamental terms:

- **Class** - a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects of the class will have.

- **Object** - an instance of a class. Objects are created based on the structure defined by the class and represent a real-world entity with its own state and behavior.

- **Encapsulation** - the bundling of data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class). It helps in hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only what is necessary.

- **Inheritance** - mechanism that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors of an existing class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reusability.

- **Polymorphism** - the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same message (method call) in a way that is specific to their class. It can take the form of method overloading or method overriding.

- **Abstraction** - the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors. It involves hiding the unnecessary details while exposing the essential features.

- **Method** - a function defined within a class. It represents the behavior of the objects created from that class.

- **Properties** - data member of a class. It represents the characteristics or properties of an object.

- **Constructor** - a special method that is called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the object's state.

- **Destructor** - a special method that is called when an object is destroyed or goes out of scope. It is used to perform cleanup operations.

- **Interface** - a collection of abstract methods that defines a contract for classes that implement it. It helps achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in programming languages that support it.

- **Encapsulation** - the bundling of data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit. It helps in hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only what is necessary.
