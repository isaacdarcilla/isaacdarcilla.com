### How. Why.

In the early days of 2018, my fascination with web development took an exciting turn when I discovered Laravel.
The elegant and expressive syntax of the PHP framework immediately captivated me, and I realized that
this was a tool that could shape my future in the world of technology.

### More To It

However, my journey in the tech world had begun two years earlier, back in 2016 when I started coding in PHP.
The language became my first love, and I delved into various open source projects to hone my skills. One notable achievement
during this period was the development of our thesis project, a Contest System. The project, available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/isaacdarcilla/pageant-management-system),
not only showcased my programming prowess but also fueled my passion for creating practical solutions through code.

### My First Job

After successfully completing my studies, armed with a degree and a solid understanding of PHP and Laravel, I took
the plunge into the professional realm. In 2019, fresh out of graduation, I secured a position as a Computer Programmer.
This marked the beginning of my formal career in the IT industry, where I could apply my skills in a real-world setting.

### Improving

As I embraced my role, I realized the need to diversify my skill set. In 2020, I embarked on a journey of exploration,
venturing into the realms of TypeScript, JavaScript and CSS. This expansion into frontend technologies broadened my perspective,
allowing me to contribute to full-stack development and enhance my ability to create seamless and responsive web applications.

### And Beyond!

Fast forward to the present, and I find myself celebrating five years in the IT industry. This journey, from the initial discovery of
Laravel to becoming proficient in both backend and frontend technologies, has been a rewarding and transformative experience.
Each project, every challenge, and all the late-night coding sessions have contributed to shaping me into the professional I am today.

Looking ahead, I am eager to continue growing, learning, and contributing to the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
My journey is ongoing, and I am excited to see where the next five years in the IT industry will take me. Through dedication,
continuous learning, and a passion for coding, I am confident that the adventure is only just beginning.
